Going down to the swamp
Gonna watch me a hound dog catch a 'coon
Well, I'm going down to the swamp
Gonna watch me a hound dog catch a 'coon
You know the hound dog make a music
On a summer night under a full moon

Lord, fetch my cane pole mama
Gonna catch a bream or maybe two
Lord, fetch my cane pole mama
Gonna catch a bream or maybe two
When the hound dog start barkin'
Sounds like ol' Son House singin' the blues

Hound dog sing that
Swamp, swamp, swamp, swamp music
Swamp, swamp, swamp, swamp music
When the hound dog starts singin'
I ain't got them big ol' city blues

Well, hey pretty mama
Lord, just take that city hike
Said, "Go ahead pretty mama"
Lord, just take your city hike
Well, I'd rather live with the hound dogs
For the rest of my natural born life
That's right

Singing that
Swamp, swamp, swamp, swamp music
Swamp, swamp, swamp, swamp music
Well, I'd rather live with the hound dogs
For the rest of my natural born life
Well, I'd wanna live with the hound dogs
For the rest of my natural born life
