```
Welcome to my heaven
If you wanna be down come I'll save you
Open up the rusty door I'll take you
I promise that you'll never be lonely
Hear me out
I can be your one and only friend
Believe me
Don't let me be alone
Just stay close to me now
Boy let me drown in your sea of dark
Yeah this is what I'm made for
Sorry but I'm not a doll
Burning swamp it's where I'm from ay ay ay
There's always a siren
It echoes in the silence
And I try to call your name
I want you to feel my pain
No loss, no time, no hurt, no need to change
Here is my heaven
If you wanna be down come I'll save you
Open up the rusty door I'll take you
I promise that you'll never be lonely
Be together
'Cause you say you love me till the end
Believe me
Don't let me be alone
Just stay close to me now
Boy let me drown in your sea of dark
Yeah this is what I'm made for
Sorry but I'm not a doll
Burning swamp it's where I'm from ay ay ay
You and I were made of glass
How do we fall apart
I'm just gonna play my part
Nothing's gonna break my heart
Tell me how you feel inside
I'll love you forevermore
Believe me
Don't let me be alone
Just stay close to me now
Boy let me drown in your sea of dark
Yeah this is what I'm made for
Sorry but I'm not a doll
Burning swamp it's where I'm from ay ay ay
